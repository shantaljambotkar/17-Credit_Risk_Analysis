# 17-Credit_Risk_Analysis

Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:

## The purpose of this analysis: (4 pt)

The purpose of this analysis is to use the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company. We need to oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Following that we need to use a combinatorial approach of over and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. 

Next, we need to compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. 

Once the performance of all 6 models are evaluated a written recommendation will be required on whether they should be used to predict credit risk or not.

## Reports of the 6 machine learning models:

1. Oversampling

2. SMOTE Oversampling

3. Undersampling

4. Combination (Over and Under) Sampling
## Summary:

There is a summary of the results (2 pt)
There is a recommendation on which model to use, or there is no recommendation with a justification (3 pt)
